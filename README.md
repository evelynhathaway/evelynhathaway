## 👩‍💻 I'm currently working on...

Overengineering my portfolio! Fun fact, the background header image is generated using an offscreen canvas using the user agent string, so [take a peek at it](https://evelyn.dev/) on a few devices!

[Rocketry.js](https://github.com/rocketryjs) is my mega project where I control RGB lights and buttons on MIDI controllers. It's a exciting take on hardware control using TypeScript.

Occasionally I will also work on my glitch art style [pixel sorting web application](https://github.com/evelynhathaway/pixel-sort) that uses off the main thread scripting in React.


## 💼 I'm currently working at...

**Blue Origin!** 🚀🌌 I am developing customer-focused web applications. Previously, I also built a killer web app that manages high-performance computing jobs on AWS. [Learn more on my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evelynhathaway/).


## 🕗 Some interesting past work...

<details><summary>Show more</summary>

Adding strong TypeScript typings for Bind Deep ([`bind-deep`](https://github.com/evelynhathaway/bind-deep)). [The first draft was undoubtedly a challenge, but so worth it!](https://twitter.com/eeveedev/status/1270210745788055552)

Will Mutate ([`will-mutate`](https://github.com/ceoss/will-mutate)) is a Babel plugin that alerts if a mutation event occurred on inputted objects — essentially, a silly version of TypeScript read-only types... but at runtime. And [oh golly does it make use of ES6 Proxies](https://github.com/ceoss/will-mutate/blob/master/plugin/proxify.js).
