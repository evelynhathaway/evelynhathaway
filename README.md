## 👩‍💻 I'm currently working on...

**Webfront Studio ([@webfrontstudio](https://github.com/webfrontstudio))!** There is a gap in accessible website generators that don't require development experience. So, I am aiming to produce an accessible and open source website creator geared towards small businesses and organizations. Want to get involved? [Shoot me an email](mailto:github@evelyn.dev).

### 🥅🌈 Goals

- Entirely open and transparent, including the source code
- Feature a content management system that guides users into making accessible and inclusive content
- Require no development knowledge from small organizations
- Be self-hostable and extensible for developers

## 💼 I'm currently working at...

**[Blue Origin](https://www.blueorigin.com/)!** I am developing web applications with delightful user experiences that put people and payloads in space. 🚀🌌

## 🕗 Some interesting past work...

<details><summary>Show more</summary>

Adding strong TypeScript typings for Bind Deep ([`bind-deep`](https://github.com/evelynhathaway/bind-deep)). [The first draft was undoubtedly a challenge, but so worth it!](https://twitter.com/eeveedev/status/1270210745788055552)

Will Mutate ([`will-mutate`](https://github.com/ceoss/will-mutate)) is a Babel plugin that alerts if a mutation event occurred on inputted objects — essentially, a silly version of TypeScript read-only types... but at runtime. And [oh golly, does it make use of ES6 Proxies](https://github.com/ceoss/will-mutate/blob/master/plugin/proxify.js).

My overengineered portfolio! Fun fact, the background header image is generated using an offscreen canvas using the user agent string, so [take a peek at it](https://evelyn.dev/) on a few devices!

[Rocketry.js](https://github.com/rocketryjs) is my mega project where I control RGB lights and buttons on MIDI controllers. It's an exciting take on hardware control using TypeScript.

Occasionally I will also work on my glitch art style [pixel sorting web application](https://github.com/evelynhathaway/pixel-sort) that uses off the main thread scripting in React.
